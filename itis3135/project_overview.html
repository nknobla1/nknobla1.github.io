        <h2>Project Overview</h2>

        <p>
            The the purpose of this website will be to offer a look into the 
            hand crafted product's of the client's jewlery and crafts buisness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The intended users of this website would be to gleen 
            a little bit more information into the product of my client. 
            Like promos of the products, how they are made perhaps, and maybe a 
            bit of information about the client themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, the website will be an informational one with links 
            to the client's actual buisness website. This will work as a way to prep and 
            inform any potential clients and hopefully bolster their newly created buisness.
