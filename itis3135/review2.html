        <ul>
            <li>
                File Structure: Client requested that Bogdan use Wordpess to make their site, 
                so file structure looked different but it still appeared to be neat and organized.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design (CRAP Priniciples): The site appears to effortlessly follow the Crap priniciples, 
                being well aligned and having a color scheme that lends itself well to contrast. Nothing is too bunched up, 
                and it's repeatable elements were within tolerable standards from my point of view.
            </li>
            <li>Page Structure: Pages seemed to contain the required stucture and elements in order. 
                Evaluation was conducted over a Discord call due to the unpublished nature of the site.
            </li>
            <li>Header Evaluation: Meets requirements.</li>
            <li>Main Starts w/ H2: Appears to meet requirements.</li>
            <li>Does the Page have a Slogan: Unsure on this front, as the Bogdan is still coordinating with the client on aproval for certain elements.</li>
            <li>Footer Evaluation: It appeared to be in order and well detailed.</li>
            <li>Requirements Met: Exceed the required page count for the requirements. Final product is looking promising once all the interactive elements are finalized.</li>
