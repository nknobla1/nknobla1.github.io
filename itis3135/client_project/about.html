            The Client, Kristyna Knoblauch, passionately makes her crafts with emphasis on 
            "Outstanding service | Affordable pricing | Handmade | Hand Assembled"
        </p>

        <p>
            The above quote is pulled directly from her site. She is an avid crafter and 
            diligent worker. She had already sold a number of product at craft fair events, and had recently 
            decided to take her new found buisness to the next level. A website by which to view and sell her products.

            This page is created in large part to help this creator reach a larger audience. 
            By giving a glimp into her product, and more background info.
