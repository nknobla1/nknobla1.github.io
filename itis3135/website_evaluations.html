        <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube is an example of a Well Designed Website</a></h3>
        <p>One of my most frequented sites, Youtube, is a website for video entertainment and other assorted video content viewing. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>C - Contrast: Uses black font against a white background, making it easy to read and navigate.</li>
            <li>R - Repetition: The layout is in a repeatable format for easy of finding specific sections for viewing.</li>
            <li>A - Alignment: Everything is in a neat column format, with noticable breakage being only for ads.</li>
            <li>P - Proximity: With it being aligned properly, there isn't much clutter if at all.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3><a href="https://www.arngren.net/" target="_blank">ARNGREN is an example of a Terrible Website</a></h3>
        <p>ARNGREN is a website whose goal is to sell a variety of technologies to a consumer. But it fails on almost every CRAP design principle. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>C - Contrast: It uses alot of bright colors against white backgrounds.</li>
            <li>R - Repetition: It's consistant in its usage of boxing elements, but it isn't uniform in its execution.</li>
            <li>A - Alignment: Almost nothing outside of the sidebar is uniform in tis alignment.</li>
            <li>P - Proximity: The whole site is the definition of clutter.</li>
        </ul>
