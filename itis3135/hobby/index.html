            </figure>

            <p>
                Not too extravagent of a hobby, but I am a collector of a multitude of "nerdy" things.
                Such as comic books, trading cards, physical movie media, and action figures.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have been collecting for several years now, and a quick google search will define a hobby as:
                an activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure. Seems to fit the bill in my opinion.
            </p>

            <h2>The Collection Details</h2>
            
            <p>
                Below I'll List Some Particulars. 
                In terms of what I collect. 
                As well as a small pictorial example.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Comics ~ Namely DC and Marvel</li>
                <li>Trading Cards ~ Yu-Gi-OH!</li>
                <li>Physical Media ~ 4Ks and Blu Rays</li>
                <li>Action Figures ~ Namely Godzilla, Transformers, Alien, and Predator Figures</li>

            <h2>Scheduling</h2>

                <figcaption> Pulling a comic out of one of my storage boxes.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Other than Comic Books, which is a once a month pick up.
                There is no real schedule to the "when" of my collecting procurement. 
                Unless a preorder had been priorly placed, and a purchse is expected.
            </p>

            <p>
                Preordered purchases I am alerted to and budget around to either confirm said purchase, or let the opportunity pass.
                It is a minor decision making skill, but one that is important for finding balance.
                Therefore balance is key to both the scheduling of purchasing, and for my wallet.
            </p>

        <section id="where">

            <h2>Procurement</h2>

            <p>
                Most things such as the movies, figures, and trading cards are procured online via online shops.
                But the comic books are acquired throuhg a local comic shop. 
                When it comes to retail comic shops, I've always found it fundmentally important to support your local shops. 
            </p>

                <img alt="example of comic storage" src="images/comicBoxes.jpeg">
                <figcaption>These are what I store my comics in.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                I was unable to procure an image of my local comic shop, and insteand inluded an image of my organized comic collection.
                They are organized into these many comic boxes, and stands as evidence of my many comics aquired.
                All from the same local comic shop, for many years.
            </p>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How do I Manage So Many Items?</h2>
            <p>
                Managing such a large assortment of items can be tough, but I have boxes for organizing and stacking comics.
                A large specialized shelf for managing my physical movie media.
                Also a large assortment of shelves for managing the figures.
                Dusting and cleaning the items is important for keeping the value of said items. 
            </p>

        <section id="why">

            <h2>Why do I Collect?</h2>

            <figure>
                <img alt="more figures" src="images/figuresHanging.jpeg">
                <figcaption>More Figures!!</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Collecting is something I always admired people for doing.
                It's almost like trophy hunting for things the encapsulate your life and/or childhood.
            </p>

            <p>
                The deeper question to ask is, why do anything?
                It's because of the desire to feel happy, and comfortable in your surroudings.
                I get to wake up everyday and see a multitude of items that remind me of all the things that did and do make me happy.

        <section id="ai">
            <h2>How was AI used for this project?</h2>

            <p>
                AI was used to develope a "blank" outline for the JavaScript section.
                From there the blanks were filled in to fit the HTML code I made for the project.
